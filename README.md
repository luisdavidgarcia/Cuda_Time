A repo dedicated to learning how to program with Cuda

I am following the tutorial found here: [Cuda Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86FAWCzIe_4)

## Nvidia Toolkit

Go directly to the Nvidia website to download. Then to ensure you've installed 
correctly do:

```sh
nvcc --version
nvidia-smi
```

If both of these commands work then you are doing good.
